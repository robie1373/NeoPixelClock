The microcontroller is a Flora. Timekeeping is handled by a Chronodot RTC. ![Spaghetti is fun!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kh856y4whvl23u2/2014-05-02%2008.56.08.jpg) The big cap is there to protect the Neopixels as per Adafruits best practices. I don't think it's really needed in this project since the power source is either LiPo batter or the charger. Better safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nThere's a 5-way button on the back for future use. ![5-way button](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggwopejfyrr9vcb/2014-05-02%2008.56.22.jpg)\r\n\r\nPower is supplied by a LiPo ![The power.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qyt96qkjhdjcxf4/2014-05-02%2008.57.13.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd here is the near finished product. ![A clock](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ayd7cp7856c0bkc/NeoPixelClock2.jpg)\r\n\r\nWatch it work :)\r\n![Minutes being added.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvdj26xqjhex3ug/2014-04-29%2012.10.40.mov) ![Hours draining out at noon and midnight](https://www.dropbox.com/s/21tzag4ujq0l8bd/2014-04-29%2012.00.52.mov)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
